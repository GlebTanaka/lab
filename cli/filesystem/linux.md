# Filesystem â€” Linux

Use this page to jot down commands, examples, and notes as you learn Linux filesystem CLI.

## Core topics
- Paths and navigation (pwd, cd, ls)
- Inspecting files (cat, less, head, tail)
- Creating/changing files (touch, mkdir, rm, rmdir)
- Copying/moving (cp, mv)

mkdir -p demo/subdir && ls -R demo
cp -r demo demo_copy && mv demo_copy demo_mv && rm -rf demo_mv
head -n 5 /etc/passwd | nl
find . -type f -name "*.md"
```
